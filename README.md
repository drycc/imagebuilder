Drycc (pronounced DAY-iss) Workflow is an open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that adds a developer-friendly layer to any [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster, making it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers.

For more information about the Drycc Workflow, please visit the main project page at https://github.com/drycc/workflow.

We welcome your input! If you have feedback, please [submit an issue][issues]. If you'd like to participate in development, please read the "Development" section below and [submit a pull request][prs].

# About

The imagebuilder downloads a git archive ([gzip](http://www.gzip.org/)ped [tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/)ball) from a specified [S3 API compatible server][s3-api], compiles a [slug](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-compiler) and uploads it to a specified S3 API compatible server.

This component is usually launched by the [Drycc Builder](https://github.com/drycc/builder) and used inside the Drycc [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service), but it is flexible enough to be used as a pod inside any Kubernetes cluster.

Please see https://github.com/drycc/builder/blob/master/README.md for a more detailed description of how `imagebuilder` interacts with `builder`.
